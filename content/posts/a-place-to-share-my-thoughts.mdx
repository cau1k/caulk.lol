## Preface

I've always enjoyed writing. So much so that a rather important part of my career was writing for other people -- congressmen, coalitions, F500 CEOs. But I never really got to write for myself after college. Watching my beautiful girlfriend write for both herself and others comes at a great inspiration for me. I similarly take inspiration from [Thorsten Ball](https://registerspill.thorstenball.com), and mostly [Simon Willison](https://simonwillison.net/), whom of which has dedicated much of his personal time to educating the masses on all things AI, programming, and data.

So, here we are. Welcome to my archive of thoughts, experiments, and findings. You're welcome to subscribe:
