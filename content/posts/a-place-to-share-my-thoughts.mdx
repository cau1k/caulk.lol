## Preface

I've always enjoyed writing. So much so that a rather important part of my career was writing for other people -- congressmen, coalitions, *my boss*. But I never really got to write for myself after college. Watching my beautiful girlfriend write for both herself and others comes as a great inspiration to me. I similarly take inspiration from [Thorsten Ball](https://registerspill.thorstenball.com), and especially [Simon Willison](https://simonwillison.net/), who has dedicated many years of his to educating the masses on all things AI, programming, and data.

So, here we are. Welcome to my archive of thoughts, experiments, and findings. ~~You're welcome to subscribe:~~
