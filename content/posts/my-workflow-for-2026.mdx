<Callout type="info" title="Foreword">
  This post is hugely inspired by the incredible work Peter Steinberger has been doing with [his coding agents](https://steipete.me/posts/2025/shipping-at-inference-speed) over the past year and some change. His work truly is an inspriation to someone like me, who took their exit from development, and later returned because of how fucking fun AI has made coding.
