<Callout type="note" title="FOREWORD">
  This post is hugely inspired by the incredible work [Peter Steinberger](https://steipete.me/posts/2025/shipping-at-inference-speed) has been doing with [his coding agents](https://github.com/steipete). His work truly is an inspriation to someone like me, who took their exit from development, and later returned because of how insanely fun (and sometimes easy) AI has made programming.
