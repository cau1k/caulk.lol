About two years ago, I started playing around with [Cursor](https://cursor.com) after a multi-year hiatus from programming. Why was I back, hacking away at a new project with an AI that was good at predicting my next edit? The answer isn't exactly clear, but it is in part due to the time I spent advocating for many creatives in spaces affected by AI. Think music, art, etc. I was skeptical, but knew this would become something greater than than I could imagine.

I had completely discounted the idea of using AI to program as I was convinced that it was a glorified autocomplete. But I started hacking away on a Valentines Day-themed quiz for my girlfriend. It had been my first time using React in years, and not much had changed. Next.js had changed quite a bit--now using the app router.
