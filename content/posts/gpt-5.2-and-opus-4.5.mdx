OpenAI declared a "[code red](https://fortune.com/2025/12/02/sam-altman-declares-code-red-google-gemini-ceo-sundar-pichai/)" on Monday, December 1st, due to increased market competition, namely, the introduction of Google Gemini's 3 Pro. Just under two weeks later, as a result, OpenAI [released GPT-5.2](https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-5-2/). However, after using the model for quite some time in legitimate coding tasks, I'm not sure we can be certain that OpenAI's code red response was good enough.

Now I haven't used Gemini 3 Pro as much as I'd like. I began testing it in Antigravity, Google's [Windsurf-based](https://x.com/silasalberti/status/1990898984706036125) vibe coding editor, and it was a PITA to use due to capacity/rate limiting issues.

And now, I'm running into the same [issue]() with GPT-5.2 on Microsoft Foundry/Azure. I tried using it on OpenRouter, but I couldn't stand the sub-30 tk/s responses. Fortunately, I've been using it with my ChatGPT subscription in Codex and OpenCode, and I'm still unsure if it deserves any trophies.
