## Writing Blog Posts

Blog posts are MDX files stored in `content/posts/`. You can create and edit posts in several ways:

### Option 1: GitHub Interface (Easiest for Mobile)
- Use GitHub's mobile app or website
- Navigate to `content/posts/` and create a new `.mdx` file
- Perfect for quick posts on-the-go

### Option 2: Decap CMS Admin Interface (Best UX)
- Visit `/admin` for a user-friendly content management interface
- Optimized for mobile devices with rich text editing
- Requires OAuth setup - see [ADMIN_SETUP.md](./ADMIN_SETUP.md) for instructions

### Option 3: Local Editor
- Clone the repository
- Edit files in `content/posts/`
- Use your favorite code editor

See [ADMIN_SETUP.md](./ADMIN_SETUP.md) for detailed instructions on all options.
